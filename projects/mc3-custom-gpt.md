I worked alongside a teammate to build a **custom GPT compliance assistant for MC3 Technologies**, and it was integrated into the company’s Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) website. The assistant was documented and prompt-trained on CMMC IG1 standards to give small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) quick and easily accessible assistance to their cyber needs.

For many SMBs, becoming CMMC Level 1 compliant helps ensure they meet basic cybersecurity expectations when working with the Department of Defense.

### What it does
- Translates CMMC IG1 requirements into plain-language explanations and actionable next steps.
- Helps users draft and refine policy language, procedures, and evidence checklists aligned to common assessment expectations.
- Provides implementation tips and examples tailored to typical SMB environments.

### Example output

*Note: The assistant provides additional policies, implementation tips, and evidence guidance beyond what is shown in this screenshot.*
