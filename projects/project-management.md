During MC3 Technologies’ summer intern cohort, I supported project coordination for a drone initiative by organizing deliverables in MS Planner and collaborating with the team through daily Zoom Scrum check-ins.

### Example project tracking
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  <p style="max-width: 400px; font-style: italic;">
    Note: This screenshot shows an example of an MS Planner task bucket, where project deliverables were organized into task lists with subtasks and progress tracking.
  </p>
</div>

### What it involved
- Managing task assignments and subtasks using MS Planner buckets
- Supporting sprint planning and daily team communication
- Relaying updates between the intern team and MC3 administrators to support clear project alignment
- Helping the intern team stay aligned on priorities and milestones

### Impact
- Improved visibility and organization of project progress across the remote intern team
