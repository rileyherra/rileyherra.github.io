During my internship at MC3 Technologies, I supported a project management effort focused on coordinating tasks, timelines, and documentation for cybersecurity and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) deliverables.

This initiative helped streamline collaboration across teams and ensured timely completion of critical compliance activities.
