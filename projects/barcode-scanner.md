## Overview

During high school, I worked on a project to improve how our Creative Media Academy tracked classroom equipment. Cameras, microphones, and other gear were constantly being checked in and out, and it was easy for items to get misplaced over time.

## What We Built

Myself and two others teamed up to build a checkout system using a barcode scanner app connected to Google Forms. Scanning an item would automatically record the equipment name, the student checking it out, and the time.

The goal was to make the process faster, more organized, and less prone to manual errors.

We also used the scripting language built into Google Sheets (Google Apps Script) to help automate the barcode and inventory workflow.

Since this was a school-based project, the source code is not publicly available.
