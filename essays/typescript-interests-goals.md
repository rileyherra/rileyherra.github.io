## Interests in Software Engineering

My interest in software engineering started with simple Code.org activities back in elementary school. I thought it was really cool that you could build something just by putting steps together. Since then, I’ve learned that software engineering is not only about coding, but also about how technology is planned, designed, and improved over time. Even though programming isn’t always my favorite part, I’m interested in the bigger process of creating useful systems that people can rely on.

## Skills I Hope to Develop

One area I want to learn more about is how software engineering connects with cybersecurity. As a student on the Security Science track, I’ve started to see how important it is to build software that is not just functional, but also safe and trustworthy. I want to keep improving my understanding of secure design, testing, and how engineers prevent problems before they happen. Building quicker confidence with coding logic is another goal, especially so I can understand problems faster and translate ideas into working solutions.

Another important area for me is getting better at working on projects with other people. During my internship with MC3 Technologies, a lot of the work involved communication, organization, and staying on the same page as the team. In the future, I hope to contribute more directly to software development, including UI work on MC3’s GRC website to help support small and medium businesses working toward compliance.

## Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep building experience through this class (ICS 314), future classes, internships, and personal projects. A big next step for me is creating my first personal coding projects that I can showcase on my portfolio and keep improving over time. Software engineering is a field where there is always more to learn, and I’m looking forward to developing my skills step by step.
