## Starting Point: Learning With Minimal Experience

TypeScript, and this course, feel like a make-or-break gateway into the developer world. It's where "knowing how to code" starts translating into knowing how to build something that actually works in the real world. Before this course, my programming experience was minimal and mostly limited to coursework. I’ve worked with Java and C/C++ through UH classes, and I learned Python in high school, but never really touched it again. Because of that, I still consider myself a beginner. Most of the coding I’ve done has been for assignments, not independent projects, so I didn’t have a strong sense of what language I’d actually want to use in a real setting.

## Why TypeScript Feels Familiar

TypeScript has been a surprisingly positive experience so far, mostly because it feels familiar in a way that makes learning easier. It reminds me of the fundamentals I learned in ICS 111 with Cam Moore, especially when it comes to writing code with structure and intention. The syntax feels clean and easier to follow when I’m reading it back, which matters a lot when you’re still learning and trying to understand your own logic.

## WOD It Takes to Learn TypeScript

I’ve actually enjoyed the athletic software engineering style of learning through the practice WODs. The timed format can be stressful, but it also feels realistic: you’re working under pressure, but you still have access to resources, which is how real programming works. I’ve found that the WODs have helped improve my problem solving because they push me to think faster and adapt to keep moving forward instead of staring at my screen. Overall, TypeScript and this module have made me feel more capable not just as a student completing assignments, but as someone building skills that can carry into real projects.

## Connections to the "Real World": Growing as a Developer

This module also feels relevant to what I’m doing outside of class. I’m currently interning with MC3 Technologies throughout my college career, and I’ve had opportunities to contribute through more “behind-the-scenes” work like physical IT support with clients, project management tasks, and helping keep systems running smoothly. I’ve also helped design, organize, and run a Discord server for a cohort of students. While I’ve learned a lot from these experiences, I’m excited to build more front-end and development-focused skills so I can contribute more directly on the software side of the company, especially with projects like the GRC website to help local small-medium businesses work towards being CMMC compliant.

Looking ahead, I see TypeScript as a tool that can strengthen the agile and teamwork skills I’ve been developing. Programming isn’t just an individual task. It’s also something built through collaboration, communication, and shared understanding of the code. TypeScript encourages that kind of environment by making projects easier to read, easier to maintain, and easier for a group to work on efficiently. As I continue gaining experience, I want to become someone who can contribute not only by completing tasks, but also by supporting smoother group development and long-term project success.
